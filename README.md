# Chip-8 Emulator

The sole purpose of this project was to attempt to learn, It's not going to be finish nor do I intend to finish it. I only cared for for understanding the semantics of the Chip-8 Interpreter to better my undestanding in C++ bit-masking, classes/objects and parsing bytes from files to be interpretered.
